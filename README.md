# Weekly-Recipe-Shopping-List-Generator
This is a weekly shopping list and recipe generator to automate generating recipes for a family weekly.

Copy the file /recipe_program to C:/Python/recipe_program for now because I haven't put relative references into the file methods.

Open the .py Script and change the 'YOUR ADDRESS HERE' under the smtp methods to your e-mail address. Change the 'YOUR PASSWORD HERE' to your password once you copy the file. The SMTP in the script is set up for outlook e-mail (you may have to edit in your host of choice).

Use the bash file and create a shortcut to the desktop or use windows scheduler to run automatically on the day of your choice!

Work in progress, will update. Latest 1/2/2018
