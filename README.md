# Weekly-Recipe-Shopping-List-Generator
This is a weekly shopping list and recipe generator to automate generating recipes for a family weekly.

Copy the file /recipe_program to C:/Python/recipe_program for now because I haven't put relative references into the file methods.

Use the bash file and create a shortcut to the desktop or use windows scheduler to run automatically on the day of your choice!

Work in progress, will update. Latest 1/2/2018
